# Twitter API v2 sample code [![v2](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwbadges.glitch.me%2Fbadges%2Fv2)](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)

Sample code for early access to the Twitter v2 endpoints.
Individual API features have folders where you can find examples of usage in several coding languages (Java, Node.js, Python, R, and Ruby).

* [Twitter API v2 Documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access)
* [Getting started Documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started)

## Prerequisites

* Twitter Developer account: if you donâ€™t have one already, [you can apply](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) for one.
* A Project and an App created [in the dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).

## Using the code samples

In order to run the samples in this repository you will need to set up some environment variables. You can find your credentials and bearer token in the App inside of your Project in the [dashboard of the developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps).

For OAuth 1.0a samples, you will need to export your consumer key and secret in your terminal. Be sure to replace `<your_consumer_key>` and `<your_consumer_secret>` with your own credentials without the `< >`.

```bash
export CONSUMER_KEY='<your_consumer_key>'
export CONSUMER_SECRET='<your_consumer_secret>'
```

For samples which use bearer token authentication, you will need to export the bearer token. Be sure to replace  `<your_bearer_token>` with your own bearer token without the `< >`.

```bash
export BEARER_TOKEN='<your_bearer_token>'
```

## Language-specific requirements

### Java environment set up

If you use Homebrew, you can install a Java runtime using:

```bash
brew cask install java
```

You will also need to download the relevant JAR files referenced in the individual samples in order to build and run the code. If you use an IDE, it may be able to do this automatically for you.

### JavaScript (Node.js) environment set up

You will need to have Node.js installed to run this code. All Node.js examples use `needle` as the HTTP client, which needs to be npm installed. For OAuth with user context requests, you'll need to install the `got` and `oauth-1.0a` packages.

```bash
npm install needle
npm install got
npm install oauth-1.0a
```

### Python environment set up

You will need to have Python 3 installed to run this code. The Python samples use `requests==2.24.0` which uses `requests-oauthlib==1.3.0`.

You can install these packages as follows:

```bash
pip install requests
pip install requests-oauthlib
```

### Ruby environment set up

You will need to have Ruby (recommended: >= 2.0.0) installed in order to run the code. The Ruby examples use `typhoeus` as the HTTP client, which needs to be gem installed. For OAuth with user context requests, you'll also need to install the `oauth` gem (see below).

```bash
gem install typhoeus
gem install oauth
```
